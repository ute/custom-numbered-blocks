::: TODO
### simpletextbox

- [x] make referenceable - this works out of the box, I was sooo clever with the design ;-)
:::

::: TODO
### Change internal registration of Divs {#first}
This is relatively epic

- [ ] do not use div attributes, but an internal table
  - [ ] set up the table in parallel
    - [ ] make identifiers for all divs
    - [ ] add to cnbx.customblocks. Catch error: duplex
  - [ ] test by inspection
  - [ ] change how styles use the information
    - [x] start with fallbackexample
    - [ ] test fallbackexample 
:::

::: TODO 
# this is only for testing purposes {#second}

For example, to catch duplex identifiers
